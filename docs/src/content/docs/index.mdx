	<Card title="Gradient Designer" icon="random">
		Design complex **Linear**, **Radial**, and **Conic** gradients. Generate gradients from existing palettes or extract dominant colors from images. Export as CSS with modern `oklch` interpolation.

## Architecture

PhoenyxColor uses a modular state management approach:

- **RootStore** – Central singleton orchestrating all feature stores
- **PaletteStore** – Color palette CRUD with undo/redo history
- **GradientStore** – Gradient definitions and manipulations
- **ReferenceStore** – Reference image management
- **SettingsStore** – Application preferences
- **ThemeStore** – Dynamic theme generation from images
